Question 9
For creativity points, we implemented an automated random data generator in Python.

The data can also be generated by a given format to allow users to have more customized random
data. For example, l@mail.com will generate data that have random length of characters followed by @mail.com.

The sample random datasets that we generated for our project can be find in the csv files.
